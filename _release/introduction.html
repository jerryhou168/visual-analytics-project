                <h4>Univariate Analysis</h4>
                <div>
				<p>
				This is the first part of the R-Shiny application where users can perform Exploratory Data Analysis on two different loan dataset, with the more common tools such as Distribution Analysis, Deviation Analysis and Scatterplot.</p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Univariate.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>
				Univariate analysis is a statistical technique used to assess the symmetry and shape of single variable in a dataset. It involves examining the frequency distribution of a predictor variable to identify whether the data is normally distributed or skewed. </p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>If a variable is found to be highly skewed, this can impact the accuracy and reliability of statistical models, and may require data transformation or specialized modeling techniques.

                <h4>Bivariate Analysis</h4>
                <div>
				<p>1. Bivariate analysis, if performed through box plots, is a graphical technique used to examine the relationship between a qualitative  predictor variable and a continuous variable. </p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Bivariate-1.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>It provides a visual representation of the distribution of the continuous variable within each category of the predictor, and can reveal differences in variability or central tendency between groups.</p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>2. If the bivariate analysis is performed through Scatterplot, it is then a graphical technique used to examine the relationship between two continuous variables. </p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Bivariate-21.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>It provides a visual representation of the correlation two continuous variables between each other and can reveal correlation or clusters between two continuous variables. This can aid in identifying potential correlations between the two predictors and inform subsequent statistical analyses.</p><p><br/></p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>3. Lastly, if a bivariate analysis is performed through mosaic plot, then it is a graphical technique used to examine the relationship between two qualitative  variables. </p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Bivariate-3.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>It provides a visual representation of the correlation two qualitative  variables between each other and can reveal correlation or in between two continuous variables. This can aid in identifying potential relationships between the two predictors and inform subsequent statistical analyses.</p>

                <h4>Correlation Analysis</h4>
                <div>
				
				<p>A correlation plot can be used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. In order to handle all of variables available, categorical variables have to be transformed into numerical variables accordingly before applying to correlation plot.</p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>
				Each number on the plot represents the correlation coefficients between the pair of variables. The color density provides visualized view of strength of the correlation between the pair of variables.

				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Correlation.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>
				Correlation plot can aid in identifying potential associations between variables and provide insights into the nature of the relationship, which can inform subsequent analyses or hypotheses.

                <h4>Multicollinearity Analysis</h4>
				
				<div>
				
				<p>Multicollinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables in a machine learning model are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to identify the independent effects of each variable on the dependent variable.</p>

				<p>In a classification model, multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the coefficients and make it difficult to interpret the model’s results. It can also lead to overfitting and reduce the model’s predictive accuracy. 
				
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>To address multicollinearity, one can exclude the highly correlated variables when building classification model. To determine whether multiple variables are in danger of compromising the model by this issue, we can utilize the variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis.</p>
				
				<p><br/></p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Multicollinearity.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				
				<p>The variance inflation factor is a measure to analyze the magnitude of multicollinearity of model terms. A VIF less than 5 indicates a low correlation of that predictor with other predictors. A value between 5 and 10 indicates a moderate correlation, while VIF values larger than 10 are a sign for high, not tolerable correlation of model predictors (James et al. 2013). </p>
				
				<p><br/></p>
				<p>In the context of multicollinearity, a high correlation coefficient between two predictor variables indicates a strong linearity relationship between them. This means that one variable can be predicted well by the other, and it becomes difficult to disentangle the effects of the two variables on the dependent variable. It’s important to note that correlation doesn’t imply causation, and that multicollinearity can also occur between three or more predictor variables, not just pairs.</p>

                <h4>Quasi-Complete Separation</h4>
				
				
				
				<p>Quasi-complete separation is a situation that can occur in classification when a predictor variable perfectly separates the outcome variable into distinct categories.

				<p>In other words, when a predictor variable has a perfect linear relationship with the outcome variable, the logistic regression model can perfectly predict which category the outcome variable belongs to based on the value of the predictor variable. This means that the estimated coefficient for the predictor variable becomes infinitely large.

				<p><br/></p>
				<p>For instance, the screenshot below provided that the current accunt holders having nearly zero Bad loans, so, it is necessary to collect more data for the Current account holders in terms of Bad Loan Quality data.</p>
				<p><br/></p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Quasi-Complete-Separation2.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				
				<p>Quasi-complete separation is particularly problematic in small or moderate-sized datasets because it can lead to overfitting and unreliable coefficient estimates. In addition, the model’s performance can be sensitive to small changes in the data, which can make it difficult to interpret the results.</p>

				<p>To address quasi-complete separation, there are several approaches that can be taken. One approach is to remove the problematic predictor variable or combine it with other variables to reduce its impact.</p>

				<p>In some cases, quasi-complete separation may be a real phenomenon in the data and may require a different approach altogether. For example, if the data has a natural threshold or cutoff point, such as in medical diagnosis or credit scoring, the logistic regression model may need to be modified to account for this threshold. Overall, it’s important to be aware of quasi-complete separation and to use appropriate methods to address it when it occurs.</p>

				<p>One method of visual analytics to determine whether a predictor variable has the problem of quasi complete separation is by barchart. Quasi-complete separation can be visualized using a barchart, which can help to identify the problematic predictor variable and understand its relationship with the outcome variable.</p>

				<p><br/></p>
				<div><img src="./file/vaa/Quasi-Complete-Separation1.jpg" width="100%"/></div>
				<p><br/></p>
				
				<p>In a barchar, the predictor variable is plotted on the x-axis and the outcome variable is plotted and stacked on the y-axis. When there is quasi-complete separation, we typically see that the data points fall into two distinct groups or clusters, with no overlap between the two groups.</p>
