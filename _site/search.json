    "text": "Loan lending offers substantial profits, but also carries the risk of customers failing to repay loans on time, known as loan default risk, which is a type of credit risk.\nTo manage uncertainty, lending institutions have established lending standards and created predictive models to better evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment through credit risk assessment of customers.\nOver the past thirty years, loan default risk assessment has progressed from traditional credit scoring systems to data modeling utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques."

Another tool can be employed is Deviation Analysis (box plot), to have general understanding of 5 number summaries (min / max , lower quantile / upper quantile and median). A deviation analysis would also show outliers from dataset.\nWe also include scatterplot to present the correlation between different variables and their corresponding correlation coefficients.\n\n\n\nPrototype slide 1\n\n\nIn terms of multi-collinearity, the results will assist users to identify which variables to be excluded when perform classification models later."
