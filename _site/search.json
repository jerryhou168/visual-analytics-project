    "text": "Problem\nLoan lending is one of the most important financial services. Loan default risk assessment is part of the loan lending process; it does impact the profitability of financial institutions when the loan receiver is unable to pay back on time. Customers’ ability to pay back and willingness to pay back are essential considerations in loan lending.\n\n\nChallenges\nBeside the difficulty and accuracy of customer loan default prediction in real words, more than often, imbalanced data collected are also have significant impact on customer loan default prediction, imbalanced data can resulted in poor performance with traditional predictive models and evaluation metrics that assume a balanced class distribution.\n\n\nSolutions\nIn this project, first, two types of loans 1) new and 2) repeating loans together with customer demographics and loan history are used in this study to analyze customers’ ability to pay and willingness to pay, and predictive models are provided to evaluate factors selected on compared customer loan default prediction."

    "text": "Loan lending offers substantial profits, but also carries the risk of customers failing to repay loans on time, known as loan default risk, which is a type of credit risk.\nTo manage uncertainty, lending institutions have established lending standards and created predictive models to better evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment through credit risk assessment of customers.\nOver the past thirty years, loan default risk assessment has progressed from traditional credit scoring systems to data modeling utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques."
