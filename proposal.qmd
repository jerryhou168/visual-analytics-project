# Background

Loan lending offers substantial profits, but also carries the risk of customers failing to repay loans on time, known as loan default risk, which is a type of credit risk.

To manage uncertainty, lending institutions have established lending standards and created predictive models to better evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment through credit risk assessment of customers.

Over the past thirty years, loan default risk assessment has progressed from traditional credit scoring systems to data modeling utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques.

# Motivation

This project aims to explore R technologies to develop reusable solutions (such as R-shiny application), to support users to perform data exploration, analysis, and prediction from set of customer variables to select the optimal variables to perform the customer loan default prediction.

# Data

The data that we are using, is from Data Science Nigeria Challenge #1: Loan Default Prediction.

There are two types of risk models in general:

-   1st new business risk, which would be used to assess the risk of application(s) associated with the first loan that he/she applies.

-   2nd repeat or behavior risk model, in which case the customer has been a client and applies for a repeat loan.

Overall, we can split the data into 2 main subsets of data: For Single Loans or Repeat Loans based on number of loans per customer in the data.

# Approach

To effectively predict the customer loan default, this study aims to provide following approaches to explore, analysis, mining factors are important to evaluate loan default.

-   Loan default factor exploration: it provides visualization on all or selected factors, to allow users to understand the trends of the variables, correlation of variables between each other.
-   Loan default factor mining: it provides deep dive analysis for customer further analysis the importance of loan default factors for prediction.
-   Loan default prediction: it provides interfaces for users to select variables, sampling methods, and predictive algorithms to model and analyze factors for customer loan default prediction.

# R-Shiny App

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

This is the first part of the R-Shiny application where users can perform Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset, with the more common tools such as Distribution Analysis , Deviation Analysis and Scatterplot.

Distribution analysis is a statistical technique used to assess the symmetry and shape of a dataset. It involves examining the frequency distribution of a predictor variable to identify whether the data is normally distributed or skewed. If a variable is found to be highly skewed, this can impact the accuracy and reliability of statistical models, and may require data transformation or specialized modeling techniques.

Example:

Another tool can be employed is Deviation Analysis (box plot).
Deviation analysis, often performed through box plots, is a graphical technique used to examine the relationship between a categorical predictor variable and a continuous variable. It provides a visual representation of the distribution of the continuous variable within each category of the predictor, and can reveal differences in variability or central tendency between groups. This can aid in identifying potential correlations between the two predictors and inform subsequent statistical analyses.

Example:

Another type of analysis between 2 continuous variables is a scatterplot.

A scatterplot is a graphical tool used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point on the plot represents a combination of values for the two variables, and the pattern of points can reveal the direction, strength, and form of the correlation between the variables. Scatterplots can aid in identifying potential associations between variables and provide insights into the nature of the relationship, which can inform subsequent analyses or hypotheses.

## PROTOTYPE OF FIRST PAGE

## Deeper Dive

The second section of the R-shiny apps would provide users options to experiment with other analysis types such as Multi-collinearity test and Quasi Complete Separation.

Users can perform heatmap and mosaic plot on different variables to determine whether which variables that can be applied to the subsequent prediction models.

## Loan default prediction using classification algorithms

Upon analyzed variables suitable for loan default prediction from section 1 and section 2, the section 3 here is provided interactive interface allow users to between different resampling methods.

![Prototype slide 3](images/Slide3.png)

Users can choose to include or exclude the highly correlated variables to see the effects of whether oversampling versus under sampling versus original data.

Users also can select different classification models, and our applications will showcase the results of the models using AOC analysis for prediction accuracy.
