# Background

Loan lending offers substantial profits, but also carries the risk of customers failing to repay loans on time, known as loan default risk, which is a type of credit risk.

To manage uncertainty, lending institutions have established lending standards and created predictive models to better evaluate the likelihood of loan repayment through credit risk assessment of customers.

Over the past thirty years, loan default risk assessment has progressed from traditional credit scoring systems to data modeling utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques.

# Motivation

This project aims to explore R technologies to develop reusable solutions (such as R-shiny application) to support users to perform data exploration, analysis, and prediction from set of customer variables to select the optimal variables to perform the customer loan default prediction.

# Data

The data that we are using, is from Data Science Nigeria Challenge #1: Loan Default Prediction.

There are two types of risk models in general:

-   1st new business risk, which would be used to assess the risk of application(s) associated with the first loan that he/she applies.

-   2nd repeat or behavior risk model, in which case the customer has been a client and applies for a repeat loan. Overall, we can split the data into 2 main subsets of data: For Single Loans or Repeat Loans based on number of loans per customer in the data.

# Methodology

# Prototype

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

We will build an application where users can perform Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset, with the more common tools such as Distribution Analysis, to measure the skewness of data. Another tool can be employed is Deviation Analysis (box plot), to have general understanding of 5 number summaries (min / max , lower quantile / upper quantile and median). A deviation analysis would also show outliers from dataset.

We also include scatterplot to present the correlation between different variables and their corresponding correlation coefficients.

In terms of multi-collinearity, the results will assist users to identify which variables to be excluded when perform classification models later.

## Deeper analysis

![Prototype slide 2](images/Slide2.png)

Users can perform heatmap and mosaic plot on different variables to determine whether which variables that can be applied to the subsequent prediction models

## Loan default prediction using classification algorithms

![Prototype slide 3](images/Slide3.png)

For the 2nd part of the prototype, we can allow users to select between different resampling methods, to see the effects of whether oversampling versus undersampling versus original data.

Users also can select different classification models, and our applications will showcase the results of the models using AOC analysis for training dataset and validation dataset.

Based on the results of the previous multi correlated analysis, users can choose to include or exclude the highly correlated variables before building the models.
